To test with tarantula I first added a bug to the minion card in dominion.c. The bug is small, all it does is it gives the player one coin instead of two. Type "make tarantula" to run the script. minion_tarantula.c is a random tester of the minion card. This is run multiple times by tarantula.py to give suspiciousness data. After running the script it is graphically clear that the small bug is the most suspicious because it has the longest line of #### and has a suspiciousness rating of 1. Tarantula was a very clear way to locate this bug.
