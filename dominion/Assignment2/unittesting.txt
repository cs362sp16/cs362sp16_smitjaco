I started with assert statements but found its way too hard to narrow down any bugs going on. So I switched as the hint says to a pass, fail print method and worked much better, with improved code coverage and an easy way to see what failed. My average coverage is 80% but most of my tests failed for a very long time and most still do. To write the tests I thought it was easiest to break down the function into test cases that could either pass or fail and write if statements for those cases. I found that for one of the card plays the player wasn’t getting the correct number of cards from the deck.
